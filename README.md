Triumph4PHP: Win the battle against your PHP projects
============================================================
The goal of Triumph4PHP is to provide a truly integrated development environment for developing mid to large size web 
applications using the LAMP stack. The main objectives are:

 - Made specifically for PHP web applications; taking into account web application issues such as pretty URLs, 
   active record patterns, duck-typing, and virtual hosts.
 - Provide a clutter-free, tight interface for managing PHP source code that has a native look on either 
   Windows or Linux.
 - Leverage existing MVC frameworks (CodeIgniter, Symfony, CakePHP, Zend)
