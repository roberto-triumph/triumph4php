Triumph4PHP: An IDE made for PHP developers by PHP developers
============================================================
The goal of Triumph4PHP is to provide a truly integrated development environment for developing mid to large size web 
applications using the LAMP stack and the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. The main objectives are:

 - Made specifically for PHP web applications; taking into account web application issues such as pretty URLs, 
   active record patterns, duck-typing, and virtual hosts.
 - Provide a clutter-free, tight interface for managing PHP source code that has a native look on either 
   Windows or Linux.
 - Leverage existing MVC frameworks (CodeIgniter, Symfony, CakePHP, Zend)
 - Reduce the time it takes to develop and debug applications by actively communicating with 
   MySQL and Apache processes
 
License
-------
Triumph4PHP is licensed under the MIT license, meaning that both the program and the source code are provided
free of charge; however the software is provided "as is". See LICENSE file for details. 

Features
--------
  - Easy, minimal project management.
  - Modern IDE features: PHP autocompletion, call tips, and source code navigation.
  - Full CodeIgniter support: Triumph4PHP understands CodeIgniter routes, controllers, templates,
    and database config files.
  - Integrated SQL Browser: Write and run SQL queries from within the IDE, editor supports autocompletion
    when editing SQL queries.
  
Installation
------------
The latest version of Triumph4PHP is available in binary form at the project's site: 
http://code.google.com/p/triumph4php. The source code is also made available in the same place. Triumph4PHP does not 
have an installation process; it is available as a standalone executable that can be run on its own. Just 
download the distribution archive, extract, and run the mvc-editor binary.  You can choose 
to compile from source if you wish but you will need to setup your developer environment. Instructions for
setting up your development environment can be found here: http://code.google.com/p/triumph4php/wiki/DeveloperEnvironment

Software Requirements
---------------------
The following software is required to run Triumph4PHP

 - Operating System: Triumph4PHP can run on Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, most Linux distributions 
   (Ubuntu, Fedora, SusE).
 - PHP (5.0+). While not having PHP will not prevent the Editor from starting up and being able to edit files, 
   not having PHP installed will render some of the editor's features unusable. For example, the "Run" 
   feature needs the PHP interpreter to run a PHP script.

Hardware Requirements
----------------------
Triumph4PHP will take moderate resources on the system.
