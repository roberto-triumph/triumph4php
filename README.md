Triumph4PHP: Win the battle against your PHP projects
============================================================
Triumph4PHP is a cross-platform text editor and IDE with the goal of providing a truly integrated 
development environment for developing mid to large size web applications using the LAMP 
stack. The main objectives are:

 - Made specifically for PHP web applications; taking into account web application issues such as pretty URLs, 
   active record patterns, duck-typing, and virtual hosts.
 - Provide a clutter-free, tight interface for managing PHP source code that has a native look on either 
   Windows or Linux.
 - Leverage existing MVC frameworks (Symfony, Laravel, Zend, CodeIgniter, CakePHP)

Installation
------------
The latest version of Triumph4PHP is available in binary from triumph4php [main site](http://triumph4php.com). The site contains packages for Ubuntu, Fedora, Mac OS X, and MS Windows.

Status
------
While Triumph does not have every feature imaginable (and may not even have your favorite feature), Triumph is ready for every day use. Every release goes through sanity checks to make sure that it runs on Mac OS X, Ubuntu Linux, and MS Windows.

Development 
------------
Triumph exercises continuous integration; a buildbot instance runs Triumph's code on MS Windows and Ubuntu Linux to make sure that it compiles. The buildbot instance can be seen at [http://ci.triumph4php.com:8020/](http://ci.triumph4php.com:8020/).
