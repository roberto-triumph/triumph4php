In order to build properly, SQLite subdirectory should look like this. Note that this 
is only on Win32, on linux you can just use the system SQLite3 library.

lib/sqlite
lib/sqlite/include
lib/sqlite/include/sqlite3.h
lib/sqlite/lib
lib/sqlite/lib/sqlite3.dll
lib/sqlite/lib/sqlite3.lib
lib/sqlite/lib/sqlite3.exp

sqlite3.h can be found in the sqlite3 amalgamation distribution (sqlite-amalgamation-3071300.zip)
that can be downloaded from http://sqlite.org/download.html

sqlite3.dll can be found in the sqlite3 binary distribution (sqlite-dll-win32-x86-3071300.zip)
that can be downloaded from http://sqlite.org/download.html

sqlite3.lib and sqlite3.exp can be created by using the LIB.exe

lib.exe /DEF:sqlite3.def /MACHINE:x86
