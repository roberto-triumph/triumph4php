# Find #

The Find feature works similarly to most other editors. You can search,
replace, and replace all in the currently opened file.

You can find an exact match, a case-insensitive match, or a regular
expression.  The full regular expression syntax is described at 
[http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr18/](http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr18/). To the
left of the find input there is a pop-up menu that shows you the regular 
expression meta-characters that are available.  Clicking on one of them
will add it to the find expression.

Another nifty little feature is that a find is executed whenever you
double click on a single word.  When you double click on a single word,
all (case sensitive) matches of that word in the current document are highlighted.
