triumph4php allows for a fair amount of customization when creating 
make keyboard shortcuts (bindings). Both code editor actions (move to next word, copy line) 
and menu items (File .. Save All) can have keyboard bindings.

##Code Shortcuts##
triumph4php has bindings for common code actions such moving moving to
next word, moving entire lines up/down, and so on.  You can view all
code action bindings by going to Edit .. Preferences, then going to the
Editor Shortcuts tab.  The tab will list all of the actions that can
be bound. You can change a binding by double clicking on the item to be changed, 
then entering the new key combination. You cannot use a key combination that 
is already bound to another action.  You can also remove (disable) a binding by 
entering "" (empty string) in the edit dialog.

##Menu Shortcuts##
triumph4php also allows you to assign a shortcut to menu items, such
as the Search .. Total Search menu. The menu shortcuts can be edited by
going to Edit .. Preferences, then going to the Keyboard shortcuts tab. In 
this dialog  you can

1. Edit, add or remove a keyboard binding.
2. Create entirely new "profiles". A profile is a grouping of all of
   the menu shortcuts. With this feature, you can assign all menus
   shortcuts, then create a new profile with entirely different menu
   shortcuts, then switch between the two groups easily.


Why are these different?

These are different because code shortcuts are appled only while the source 
code editor is in focus, while menu shortcuts apply at all times.
