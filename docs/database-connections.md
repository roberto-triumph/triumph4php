# Database Connections #

You can add a database connection to triumph4php. The database
connection is used in the [SQL Browser](/sql-browser/).

Go to SQL ... SQL Connection to see the list of connections that
exist.  You can, edit, or remove connections from that dialog.

You can connect to a MySQL database or a SQLite file.
