#Config Detectors#

If one of your projects is using a [supported framework](/framework-detection/#supported-frameworks), triumphp4php
will put the framework's config files in the menu bar, that way you can open them with one
quick click of the mouse.

#Note#
For config detectors to work, you must have PHP installed.  Also, you must 
have PDO and PDO Sqlite extensions enabled.
