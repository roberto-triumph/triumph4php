#Explorer#

triumph4php has a pretty handy explorer panel. The explorer panel shows
you the files and sub-directories of *any* directory you choose. It will
default to show you the source directories for all enabled projects.

Clicking on the "Explore Projects" button of the toolbar will open
the explorer panel.  If there is already an explorer panel open, it 
is brought to the forefront.

If you have created projects in triumph4php, the explorer will show you
the contents of the first source directory. If you don't have any projects
enabled, the explorer shows you your home directory.

The left hand side of the explorer panel lists all of the source directories
of all of your enabled projects.  That way, you can view the contents of
the root directory of your projects quickly.

The top of the explorer panel shows you a text box that contains the current
directory being viewed. You can type in any directory in your file system
to go to that directory.

The right hand side of the explorer panel shows you the contents of the
current directory. By default, it will show you sub directories, and any file
extension that you have configured in the Edit ... Preferences Project tab. Also, by
default files with the hidden attribute are not shown.

The explorer panel can be made to display all files (or to restrict and show
only one type of file) by clicking on the filter button.  You can also
click the parent button to go to the current directory's parent.

Keyboard navigation works on the explorer panel.  The arrow keys  (up, down, left,
right) can be used to select files. Pressing Enter opens the file in 
triumph4php.  Pressing the Delete key deletes the file.  You can also hit
ALT+Left arrow to go to the parent directory.

Other explorer actions:

  * You can delete, rename files
  * You can create a file
  * You can create a new sub-directory
  * You can open a command shell to the current directory
  * You can open a Operating system file manager to the current directory

There are two explorer panels that you can use. If you use the panel
by using the View -> Explore Sources menu then the explorer panel is placed
at the bottom of the screen (the "Tools" notebook). If you use the panel
by using the View -> Explorer In Outline then the explorer panel is placed
at the left-hand side of the screen (the "Outline" notebook).
