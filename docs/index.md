*THIS MANUAL IS A WORK IN PROGRESS*

# triumph4php manual #

# Introduction #
The idea for triumph4php was borne out of a need to remove the tediousness out of PHP programming. PHP itself is a 
simple language that is easy to learn; however there currently does not exist an editor that is tailor-made for it.  

## Yet Another Editor? ##
There are many, many editors that people use to develop their PHP applications.  This fact alone highlights the 
need for a tight, consistent PHP development environment. Most editors can be customized to a degree to support 
PHP; but since they were not built with PHP in mind the customization still does not create a tight, controlled 
interface.

## Core Values ##
  1. This will be an editor designed for PHP web applications.  It will recognize and handle dependencies on a 
     web server and a RDBMS. It will handle issues that are common to PHP web applications such as URL routing, 
	 SQL queries, HTML escaping, and model / controller / view separation.
  2. The editor will support many of the current generation of convention-over-configuration frameworks.  The editor
     will recognize that a project built using a framework; and will use knowledge of the framework to perform tasks 
	 such as opening database connections and resolve URL mappings.
  3. The editor will have a simple interface; it will let the user focus on writing the application and not clutter 
     the tool bars and menu bars with options that are seldom used.
